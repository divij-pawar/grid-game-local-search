# Grid Game Local Search

This project implements a **grid coloring problem** where an agent colors a square grid using brushes of different shapes and colors. The goal is to color all squares while ensuring that no adjacent squares share the same color. The agent uses **first-choice hill climbing** to solve the problem efficiently.
